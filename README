Algorithm::Viterbi - Decoding Hidden Markov Models
==============================================================================

This module contains an implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for decoding
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It contains a class Algorithm::Viterbi, which
handles the actual decoding of the HMM, and Algorithm::Viterbi::HMM which
represents the HMM.

XXX: An implementation of the Forward algorithm would probably use the same
datastructure, so it would make sense to share the HMM class between them. How
to best to this? Inverse the hierarchy, and have Algorithm::HMM contain all
things HMM, or some other form of cleverness? See how CPAN handles this.
